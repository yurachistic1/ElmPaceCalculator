Small project to help me time my runs and calculate the pace.

My first endeavour into Elm to get my head around the basics. I found the [elm guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) very helpful as well as this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEitFAY7Gc8&list=LL3DN4msoXMXBKLZjdAL8LzA&index=3&t=0s) to better understand Elm architecture.
